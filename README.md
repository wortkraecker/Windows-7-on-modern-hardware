# Windows-7-on-modern-hardware
Here I'll list all available tools, tweaks and infos on how to install Windows 7 on modern/unsupported hardware.

Windows 7 is a beloved operating system released by Microsoft in 2009. Many people look back on it as the best operating system ever made and I'd have to lie if I say that it isn't also my favorite.
Growing up with it, it taught me much about how Windows and the world of computers work. But as of 2020, support has been discontinued and the OS has gotten obsolete.
For a lot of people, Windows 10/11 just isn't up to par with Windows 7 and want to return to it. But as you might have noticed, Windows 7 doesn't really wanna install on "modern" hardware as easily as it used to.
But enough with the chit chat, let's get to it.
In this repo I wanna share all tips, tweaks and software that might make Windows 7 usable again. 

# Installation Media
A detailed process involving the preparation of installation media, integrating the old ISO files with modern hardware drivers, and troubleshooting tips can be found in this repo:

# Drivers
One issue you might have come across are drivers. Many manufacturers don't make drivers for Windows 7 anymore which is obviously a problem for this undertaking.

Nvidia Drivers:

Somewhat up to date drivers for Nvidia GPUs.
All GPUs up to the RTX 30 generation have official drivers released by Nvidia.
