# Windows-7-on-modern-hardware
Here I'll list all available tools, tweaks and infos on how to install Windows 7 on modern/unsupported hardware.

Windows 7 is a beloved operating system released by Microsoft in 2009. Many people look back on it as the best operating system ever made and I'd have to lie if I say that it isn't also my favorite.
Growing up with it, it taught me much about how Windows and the world of computers work. But as of 2020, support has been discontinued and the OS has gotten obsolete.
For a lot of people, Windows 10/11 just isn't up to par with Windows 7 and want to return to it. But as you might have noticed, Windows 7 doesn't really wanna install on "modern" hardware as easily as it used to.
But enough with the chit chat, let's get to it.
In this repo I wanna share all tips, tweaks and software that might make Windows 7 usable again.
